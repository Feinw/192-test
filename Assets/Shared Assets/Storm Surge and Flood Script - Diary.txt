NEWLINEA storm surge is water pushed inland by very strong winds, usually during very strong typhoons; on the other hand, a tsunami happens when water is displaced by earthquakes. NEWLINENEWLINEIn a tsunami scenario, people only have up to 10 to 15 minutes to run to higher ground. What will happen? The community is big. Everyone will run, there will be panic and it can cause a stampede. In the case of a storm surge, there is more time to prepare and get one's bearings. Technology, such as the one Project NOAH is developing, allows people to predict a storm surge days before it happens.NEWLINENEWLINEBelow is an animation made by NIST that demonstrates what a storm surge looks like:NEWLINEhttps://www.nist.gov/video/storm-surge-animation	1

NEWLINE NEWLINE  Now that’s quite a lot of numbers to remember, and guess what, that’s not even all of them yet! Sadly, though, not everyone is blessed with very special elephant memory (as they say, elephants never forget!). However! We must never fear, for our cellphones are here!  Simply add and save these contact details on your phone and you’ll be good to go. NEWLINE NEWLINE  On a more serious note, there are also certain things you must remember when calling for help: As cliche as it is to say <b>not to panic</b>, it really is the best thing you can do in emergency situations where every second is important. <b>Communicating as clearly and concisely</b> is the most effective way to get help as soon as possible. <b>Always be patient and answer the operator’s questions</b>. Don’t think that they are simply wasting your time asking their questions. Most of the time, the operators follow a certain protocol that will ensure a more effective and efficient rescue. NEWLINE NEWLINE  To end this diary entry, always remember, as wise man Benjamin Franklin once said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” NEWLINE NEWLINE   Check out the other emergency numbers below!: NEWLINE https://www.gov.ph/hotlines NEWLINE  https://philkotse.com/safe-driving/10-philippine-emergency-hotline-numbers-must-know-to-save-your-life-5618 NEWLINE  https://www.ecomparemo.com/info/government-numbers-and-emergency-hotlines-you-should-store-in-your-phone-book-now/ NEWLINE  https://airgurus.ph/2017/04/24/need-keep-emergency-hotline/ NEWLINE	1
