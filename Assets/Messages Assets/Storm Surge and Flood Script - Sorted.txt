event1	8	Jacob	i thought it was just a bunch of spam	event1	9	-1

event1	10	Holly	What??	event1	11	-1	
event1	11	Holly	Who knows what bad thing could have happened if you haven’t mentioned that! You could have drowned, you could have contracted some stomach disease, or even suffered from leptospirosis!	event1	12	-1	
event1	12	Jacob	yeah, yeah	event1	13	-1	
event1	13	Jacob	you can’t blame me	event1	14	-1	
event1	14	Jacob	i literally thought “storm surge” was just a fancy term for “heavy rain”	event1	15	-1	
event1	15	Jacob	they didn’t teach it at school	event1	16	-1	
event1	16	Holly	Well, you’re not completely blameless either, you know.	event1	17	-1	
event1	17	Jacob	yeah, i know	event1	18	-1	
event1	18	Jacob	i'm just hoping it’s not too late to realize that yet	choice	10,11	-1	
event1	19	Holly	Don’t say that!	event1	21	-1	
event1	20	Holly	[Player] is right.	event1	21	-1	
event1	21	Holly	You can still try making last minute preparations to lessen the damage.	event1	22	-1	
event1	22	Holly	What does the NDRRMC text say?	event1	23	-1	
event1	23	Jacob	they said they’re anticipating the storm surge three days from now	event1	24	-1	
event1	24	Holly	Good.	event1	25	-1	
event1	25	Jacob	good? I mean I know all about storm surges now but i still have no clue what to do	event1	26	-1

event1	29	Jacob	oh hey	event1	30	-1	
event1	30	Jacob	i just received another message from ndrrmc	event1	31	-1	
event1	31	Jacob	they said that there’s an evacuation center not far from my current location and that it’s currently safe to evacuate	event1	32	-1	
event1	32	Jacob	i guess i better go tell my family	event1	33	-1

event1	39	Jacob	i’ll talk to you guys again later when i get there	evac	0	-1	
event2	0	Jacob	huh? why?	event2	1	-1	
event2	1	Holly	oh, i get it!	event2	2	-1	
event2	2	Holly	It won’t be safe to pump water out of the basement if there’s still water surrounding the walls from the outside.	event2	3	-1	
event2	3	Holly	Right now, the pressure inside and outside the basement are a bit balanced, considering that your basement walls are still up.	event2	4	-1	
event2	4	Holly	But if you reduce the pressure from the inside, your walls might not be able to take the outside pressure.	event2	5	-1	
event2	5	Jacob	and it will break…	event2	6	-1	
event2	6	Holly	Exactly.	event2	7	-1	
event2	7	Jacob	when is it safe to pump the water out, then	choice	24	-1	
event2	8	Jacob	oh, cool. i guess i’ll have to wait a while then	event2	9	-1	
event2	9	Jacob	i’ll see what else i can do for the meantime and maybe somewhere a bit drier	event2	10	-1	
event2	10	Holly	You know, amidst this horrible disaster, I’m actually glad that Jacob is finally learning how to listen to us.	event2	11	-1	
event2	11	Holly	He used to be so stubborn and defiant.	event2	12	-1	
event2	12	Holly	If I had known that this experience was all it would take for him to start functioning like a pleasant human being, I would have wished this on him sooner.	choice	25,26	-1	
event2	13	Holly	That was a joke, of course.	event2	14	-1	
event2	14	Holly	You didn’t think I was serious, did you?	event2	15	-1	
event2	15	Jacob	uhh, so i’m just gonna pretend i didnt see that	event2	16	-1	
event2	16	Jacob	ugh i thought the 2nd floor would be a bit drier	event2	17	-1	
event2	17	Jacob	but it’s so moist!	event2	18	-1	
event2	18	Jacob	the moistness is so extreme that i might as well just dive into the flood	event2	19	-1	
event2	19	Holly	Yikes.	event2	20	-1	
event2	20	Jacob	is there anything i should do about this? Or is there anything i could do about it?	event2	21	-1	
event2	21	Holly	Do you guys have a dehumidifier?	event2	22	-1	
event2	22	Jacob	i think we do, i might’ve seen one in the attic before	event2	23	-1	
event2	23	Holly	How about an air mover?	event2	24	-1	
event2	24	Jacob	what are those?	event2	25	-1	
event2	25	Holly	They’re basically air blowers. They’re used to improve air circulation to reduce drying times	event2	26	-1	
event2	26	Jacob	won’t an electric fan be enough?	event2	27	-1	
event2	27	Jacob	i mean… they blow air...	event2	28	-1	
event2	28	Holly	Fans usually circulate the air in multiple directions while air movers circulate them in a specific area.	event2	29	-1	
event2	29	Holly	Drying things might still be faster using an air mover.	event2	30	-1	
event2	30	Holly	However, using humidifiers and air movers can get quite tricky when using to lessen the damages from floods.	event2	31	-1	
event2	31	Holly	It usually takes the right balance of both	event2	32	-1	
event2	32	Jacob	cool, well, i can still check if we have both of them	event2	33	-1	
event2	33	Holly	Or, you know, another option is to just open your windows tolet fresh air in.	event2	34	-1	
event2	34	Jacob	what should i do?	choice	27,28	-1	
event3	0	Holly	Oh right,that completely slipped my mind for some reason.	event3	1	-1	
event3	1	Holly	I agree with [Player], keep everything electronic switched off for now.	event3	2	-1	
event3	2	Holly	I’m sorry for even suggesting it in the first place.	event3	3	-1	
event3	3	Jacob	nah, it’s fine	event3	4	-1	
event3	4	Jacob	wow, opening the windows really made the air inside feel more fresh	event3	5	-1	
event3	5	Jacob	fresher than the fresh prince of bel air haha	event3	6	-1	
event3	6	Holly	Do you even know what you’re referencing?	event3	7	-1	
event3	7	Jacob	doesnt matter, i’m feeling a little better now	event3	8	-1	
event3	8	Jacob	i can’t wait for all of this to be over	event3	9	-1	
event3	9	Holly	Can’t you just leave? That’s your relative’s house anyway. Your home in the city is probably still intact since [Player] and I are still doing alright.	event3	10	-1	
event3	10	Jacob	can’t. They’re still family, plus they need all the help they can get	event3	11	-1	
event3	11	Jacob	i’ll try looking for more stuff to do and make myself more useful	event3	12	-1	
event3	12	Jacob	i’ll be right back	event3	13	-1	
event3	13	Jacob	good news	event3	14	-1	
event3	14	Holly	Great! That took quite some time though.	event3	15	-1	
event3	15	Jacob	sure did	event3	16	-1	
event3	16	Jacob	which is why i decided to be productive	event3	17	-1	
event3	17	Jacob	who knew i had a knack for stacking cans	event3	18	-1	
event3	18	Jacob	cans are amazing	event3	19	-1	
event3	19	Jacob	not gonna lie, i was getting tempted to eat some	event3	20	-1	
event3	20	Jacob	anyways, im still hungry	event3	21	-1	
event3	21	Jacob	but all the cans are sealed and im too lazy to find the can opener	event3	22	-1	
event3	22	Jacob	guess i’ll settle with drinking water instead	choice	29,30	-1	
event4	0	Holly	Yeah, it’s important to remember that flood water isn’t just “dirty water”.	event4	1	-1	
event4	1	Holly	At this point, its probably a mix of every dirty thing you know.	event4	2	-1	
event4	2	Holly	Better be safe than sorry.	event4	3	-1	
event4	3	Jacob	i guess i should really, carefully disinfect everything	event4	4	-1	
event4	4	Jacob	ugh, my body already aches just thinking about the amount of work this will take	event4	5	-1	
event4	5	Jacob	anyways, you guys were right to tell me not to use the humidifier thing earlier	event4	6	-1	
event4	6	Jacob	i just noticed a while ago that there was a downed power line near my house	event4	7	-1	
event4	7	Jacob	i would’ve reported it but i didn’t really know who or where to call	event4	8	-1	
event4	8	Holly	You could call Meralco, though I don’t really remember what their 24/7 hotline number is.	choice	31	-1	
event4	9	Jacob	thanks thanks	event4	10	-1	
event4	10	Jacob	i should call them to check our electric… stuff here at the house too	event4	11	-1	
event4	11	Jacob	okay, just called em. what now?	event4	12	-1	
event4	12	Holly	Well, you did say that all the floodwater went down outside already, right?	event4	13	-1	
event4	13	Jacob	and?	event4	14	-1	
event4	14	Holly	You can start pumping out the water in your basement already.	event4	15	-1	
event4	15	Jacob	makes sense	event4	16	-1	
event4	16	Jacob	better prepare myself to pump all the water out, yikes	choice	32,33	-1	
event5	0	Jacob	huh, why not?	event5	1	-1	
event5	1	Jacob	it’s not flooded outside anymore	choice	34	-1	
event5	2	Jacob	but why	event5	3	-1	
event5	3	Holly	You’re still not sure if the pressure outside is lessened enough for you to pump out all the water inside safely.	event5	4	-1	
event5	4	Holly	Pumping out only a bit and leaving it overnight will make you more certain about whether it’s safe to continue or not.	event5	5	-1	
event5	5	Jacob	how?	event5	6	-1	
event5	6	Holly	If you measure the height of the water after pumping some of it out, you’ll be able to see tomorrow if the water level has increased.	event5	7	-1	
event5	7	Holly	When the water stops rising, pump out 1-3 feet again.	event5	8	-1	
event5	8	Holly	Its safest to repeat those steps until you’ve pumped out all of the water.	event5	9	-1	
event5	9	Jacob	huh… i see…	event5	10	-1

event5	11	Holly	I’ll just ignore that. After the water’s gone, try to shovel out the mud before it dries.	event5	12	-1	
event5	12	Holly	I saw this formula online too, try using this to disinfect your walls.	event5	13	-1	
event5	13	Holly	“Hose off the walls and floors with clean water and then disinfect them with a solution of 1 1/2 cups of liquid chlorine bleach to a gallon of fresh water. CAUTION	event5	14	-1

event6	1	Holly	No, we're telling you, a storm surge is really different from a tsunami.	event6	2	-1	
event6	2	Holly	We might not know how exactly they are different, but we know that they are both equally dangerous	event6	3	-1	
event6	3	Jacob	whatever. i'm not falling for this	event6	4	-1	
event6	4	Jacob	a storm surge is just an extra strong rain.	event6	5	-1

event6	12	Jacob	hey guys	event6	13	-1	
event6	13	Holly	Jacob! Where were you?? We've been trying to contact you	choice	62,63	-1	
event6	14	Holly	we saw what's happening over there all over twitter.	event6	15	-1	
event6	15	Holly	it's like...	event6	16	-1	
event6	16	Jacob	like yolanda all over again	event6	17	-1	
event6	17	Holly	right...	choice	64	-1	
event6	18	Jacob	listen guys, don't panic	event6	19	-1	
event6	19	Jacob	I'm panicking enough already	event6	20	-1	
event6	20	Jacob	I got a message two days ago from NDRRMC	event6	21	-1	
event6	21	Jacob	i didn't tell you guys because I thought it was just spam	event6	22	-1	
event6	22	Jacob	well guess what it was	choice	65,66	-1	
event6	23	Jacob	you got that right	event6	26	-1	
event6	24	Jacob	are you kidding me right now?	event6	25	-1	
event6	25	Jacob	it's a storm surge. Keep up.	event6	26	-1	
event6	26	Jacob	well, i wasn’t scared then because it wasn’t even raining THAT hard	event6	27	-1	
event6	27	Jacob	but now, if you guys were here to see this...	event6	28	-1	
event6	28	Holly	Can you still leave and evacuate?	event6	29	-1	
event6	29	Jacob	my family's preparing to, but...	event6	30	-1	
event6	30	Jacob	i saw some footage from some parts of tacloban	event6	31	-1	
event6	31	Jacob	the flood... looked like raging rivers	event6	32	-1	
event6	32	Jacob	and they said the winds are going to get stronger	event6	33	-1	
event6	33	Jacob	i’ll probably be swept away by the waters if i just leave 	event6	34	-1	
event6	34	Jacob	but if I stay… well, this house is pretty far from the coastal areas	event6	35	-1	
event6	35	Jacob	but… who knows how bad this will get?	event6	36	-1	
event6	36	Jacob	what should i do?	event6	37	-1	
event6	37	Jacob	im scared	event6	38	-1	
event6	38	Jacob	im sorry for making fun of you guys before	event6	39	-1	
event6	39	Jacob	please help me	event6	40	-1	
event6	40	Holly	Jacob...	choice	67,68	-1	
event7	0	Jacob	alright	event7	1	-1	
event7	1	Jacob	i'll trust you guys	event7	2	-1	
event7	2	Holly	it's going to be okay	event7	3	-1	
event7	3	Holly	authorities must be assisting people to evacuate at this very moment	event7	4	-1	
event7	4	Jacob	okay...	event7	5	-1	
event7	5	Jacob	you guys tell me to wait, but...	event7	6	-1	
event7	6	Jacob	i can't sit still. I gotta do something	event7	7	-1	
event7	7	Jacob	I can’t just watch the flood rising and let it get to me. 	choice	69,70	-1	
event8	0	Jacob	yeah, i guess that makes sense	event8	1	-1	
event8	1	Jacob	the higher i am, the longer it will take for the water to reach me	event8	2	-1	
event8	2	Jacob	i wouldn’t be surprised if the basement is already flooded	event8	3	-1	
event8	3	Jacob	brb Give me a minute.	event8	4	-1	
event8	4	Holly	we’ll be right here	notif	7	-1	
event8	5	Jacob	alright, im in our attic	event8	6	-1	
event8	6	Jacob	this is as high as i can possibly go	event8	7	-1	
event8	7	Jacob	my relatives are on the third floor	event8	8	-1	
event8	8	Jacob	they said the attic’s too dusty for them	event8	9	-1	
event8	9	Holly	dude how high is that house?	event8	10	-1	
event8	10	Jacob	not important	event8	11	-1	
event8	11	Jacob	anyway, i couldn’t sit still so i decided to look around	event8	12	-1	
event8	12	Jacob	guess what i found?	event8	13	-1	
event8	13	Jacob	a radio!	event8	14	-1	
event8	14	Holly	nice! But…	event8	15	-1	
event8	15	Holly	what do you need a “physical” radio for? Don’t you have a radio on your phone?	event8	16	-1	
event8	16	Jacob	dude, i want to preserve as much battery as I can	event8	17	-1	
event8	17	Jacob	just in case something bad happens…	event8	18	-1	
event8	18	Jacob	let’s stop talking about this. I wouldn’t want to jinx it, you know?	event8	19	-1	
event8	19	Jacob	anyway, our radio is plugged so I won’t be touching the wires	event8	20	-1	
event8	20	Jacob	I’ll try turning it on	choice	47,77	-1	
event9	0	Jacob	why not?	event9	1	-1	
event9	1	Jacob	that shocked me there.	event9	2	-1	
event9	2	Jacob	and I was just about to touch it	choice	48	-1	
event9	3	Jacob	huh? What do you mean? Why would i be wet?	event9	4	-1	
event9	4	Jacob	….	event9	5	-1	
event9	5	Jacob	now that you mention it. I forgot to tell you guys that i took a peek at the basement before going up to the attic	event9	6	-1	
event9	6	Jacob	and well, it was flooding there already all right	event9	7	-1	
event9	7	Jacob	hmm i guess i must have gotten wet then. I didnt even notice.	event9	8	-1	
event9	8	Jacob	Wow my pants are soaked	event9	9	-1	
event9	9	Jacob	doesn’t help that i’m also sweating from head to toe	event9	10	-1	
event9	10	Jacob	its so humid here	event9	11	-1	
event9	11	Jacob	but... What’s that got to do with the radio?	event9	12	-1	
event9	12	Holly	you might get yourself electrocuted, duh	event9	13	-1	
event9	13	Jacob	why?	event9	14	-1	
event9	14	Holly	well, you did say your radio’s still plugged. Even though you guys had a black out, there’s a chance that the plug is still carrying electric current	event9	15	-1	
event9	15	Holly	the human body is a good conductor for electricity, you know?	event9	16	-1	
event9	16	Holly	touching it with wet hands, especially, will increase the risk since water is a good conductor as well	event9	17	-1	
event9	17	Holly	moisture also actually reduces the body’s resistance to electric shocks	choice	49	-1	
event9	18	Holly	yeah, so it’s best to make sure you’re dry before touching electrical devices	event9	19	-1	
event9	19	Jacob	geez, sherlock	event9	20	-1	
event9	20	Jacob	I’m touching my phone right now, though, and I’m still fine	event9	21	-1	
event9	21	Holly	you’re not charging your phone right now, right?	event9	22	-1	
event9	22	Holly	and you’re not completely submerged in water?	event9	23	-1	
event9	23	Holly	there isn’t enough electric current in a cell phone to electrocute you	event9	24	-1	
event9	24	Holly	it’s different, though, if it’s plugged in and if you’re using a substandard (fake) charger with bad insulation	event9	25	-1	
event9	25	Holly	but that’s a story for another day	event9	26	-1	
event9	26	Holly	the bottom line is, just make sure to avoid electric devices when wet	event9	27	-1	
event9	27	Jacob	alright.	event9	28	-1	
event9	28	Jacob	thanks. You guys saved me once again.	event9	29	-1	
event9	29	Jacob	hmm i guess i better dry myself first	event9	30	-1	
event9	30	Jacob	be right back	notif	8	-1	
event9	31	Jacob	alright, i’m dry and i’ve successfully turned the radio on	event9	32	-1	
event9	32	Jacob	i’ve switched through a couple of channels but the only channels i’ve found promising so far are the news channels	event9	33	-1	
event9	33	Jacob	like Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM	choice	50	-1	
event9	34	Jacob	uhh… what is that?	event9	35	-1	
event9	35	Jacob	I dont think I do…	event9	36	-1	
event9	36	Holly	oh yeah! Ham!	event9	37	-1	
event9	37	Holly	I read about that in a news article about the storm surge in tacloban	event9	38	-1	
event9	38	Holly	there’s something called a Ham Emergency Radio Operations (HERO) that was conducted by the Philippine Amateur Radio Association (PARA)	event9	39	-1	
event9	39	Holly	I don’t know if you guys have heard about this, but during the typhoon, a school building that was being used as an evacuation center collapsed and injured some of the evacuees.	event9	40	-1	
event9	40	Holly	there weren’t any volunteers around because the typhoon was especially strong at that time	event9	41	-1	
event9	41	Holly	A HERO volunteer was able to report the incident and was able to send a request for a rescue team	event9	42	-1	
event9	42	Holly	what the HERO volunteer used to communicate this was called an amateur radio or “ham”	event9	43	-1	
event9	43	Holly	the volunteer’s request got relayed from station to station until it reached the rescue teams	event9	44	-1	
event9	44	Jacob	wow. I didn’t even know that there was such a thing as an “amateur radio”	event9	45	-1	
event9	45	Holly	well, it’s mostly for hobbyists and radio enthusiasts and you usually need to have a license for it	event9	46	-1	
event9	46	Holly	but it does prove to be useful in case of disasters	event9	47	-1	
event9	47	Holly	i’ve been thinking about getting one myself, but forgot about it until now	event9	48	-1	
event9	48	Jacob	hmm yeah maybe i should get one too	event9	49	-1	
event9	49	Jacob	would be really useful if I had one and if I knew how to operate it	choice	51	-1	
event9	50	Jacob	how so?	event9	51	-1	
event9	51	Holly	hmm… ndrrmc?	event9	52	-1	
event9	52	Jacob	oh yeah, i did receive a warning from them a few days ago	event9	53	-1	
event9	53	Jacob	ugh and im still regretting not taking it seriously	event9	54	-1	
event9	54	Jacob	but how are you sure that we’ll be receiving their messages?	event9	55	-1	
event9	55	Jacob	people from everywhere will be sending lots of messages for sure	event9	56	-1	
event9	56	Jacob	ndrrmc’s messages might arrive late	event9	57	-1	
event9	57	Holly	ndrrmc partnered with Smart and ndrrmc now sends their messages through a radio channel that’s separate from what normal citizens use in sending our text messages.	event9	58	-1	
event9	58	Holly	it’s not guaranteed, but they try to make sure the warning messages arrive early	event9	59	-1	
event9	59	Jacob	ah! Speaking of ndrrmc	event9	60	-1	
event9	60	Jacob	I just received a message	event9	61	-1	
event9	61	Jacob	they said that there’s an evacuation center not far from my current location and that it’s currently safe to evacuate	event9	62	-1	
event9	62	Jacob	i guess i better go tell my family	event9	63	-1	
event9	63	Jacob	i’ll talk to you guys again later when i get there	evac	0	-1

goodending	23	Jacob	actually…	goodending	24	-1

intro	27	Holly	What the hell?	intro	28	-1	
intro	28	Holly	That was a disaster where lots of people lost their homes, families and even their lives.	intro	29	-1	
intro	29	Jacob	well, boohoo, look for someone who cares. I’d wish ANYTHING for no classes.	intro	30	-1	
intro	30	Jacob	in fact, i kinda wish that it wouldn’t rain while we’re on vacation and just rain when classes start again	intro	31	-1	
intro	31	Jacob	so u know, extended holidays for us all	intro	32	-1	
intro	32	Jacob	right, [Player]?	intro	33	-1	
intro	33	Holly	Are you kidding? Back me up here, [Player]. I can’t be the only sensible one here.	choice	5	-1	
intro	34	Holly	Right, around 3000 people died in Tacloban, and about 6000 died, counting the other parts of the country	intro	35	-1	
intro	35	Jacob	darn(d*mn), i’m almost more surprised that you know all that on the top of your head	intro	36	-1	
intro	36	Jacob	all those people really died just because of some rain?	intro	37	-1	
intro	37	Jacob	sure, yolanda was a pretty strong bagyo, but it wasn’t that strong	intro	38	-1	
intro	38	Jacob	how do you even know these things?	intro	39	-1	
intro	39	Holly	I read the news, like what everyone should do.	intro	40	-1	
intro	40	Holly	Also, it wasn’t the rain that did the damage.	intro	41	-1	
intro	41	Jacob	the winds, then? they were pretty strong, I guess	intro	42	-1	
intro	42	Holly	No, not the winds. I think it was a tsunami.	choice	6,7	-1	
intro	43	Holly	hmm… that doesn’t sound quite right	intro	44	-1	
intro	44	Jacob	yeah it doesn’t. how is there a tsunami if it’s just a typhoon?	intro	45	-1	
intro	45	Jacob	there weren’t any earthquakes or anything	intro	46	-1	
intro	46	Holly	I know I did say it was a tsunami, but it really wasn’t. I just can’t seem to remember what actually happened.	intro	47	-1	
intro	47	Jacob	well, that’s a first	intro	48	-1	
intro	48	Jacob	maybe you can just admit that i’m right and perhaps it was the heavy rain, afterall	intro	49	-1	
intro	49	Jacob	since, u know, it’s a storm	intro	50	-1	
intro	50	Holly	That’s it!	intro	51	-1	
intro	51	Holly	I remember it now. Yes, it was a storm surge	intro	52	-1	
intro	52	Jacob	uhh…	intro	53	-1	
intro	53	Jacob	a storm surge?	intro	54	-1	
intro	54	Jacob	… an extra heavy rain?	intro	55	-1	
intro	55	Holly	You make me want to punch my face.	intro	56	-1	
intro	56	Jacob	then what is it?? Just tell me	intro	57	-1	
intro	57	Holly	well…	intro	58	-1	
intro	58	Holly	I guess you could say it’s like a tsunami.	intro	59	-1	
intro	59	Jacob	it’s like a tsunami but it’s not a tsunami?	intro	60	-1	
intro	60	Holly	Well, truth be told, I’m not really sure what a storm surge is either.	intro	61	-1	
intro	61	Holly	I just know that it’s different from a tsunami	intro	62	-1	
intro	62	Holly	[Player], do you know?	choice	9	-1	
intro	63	Holly	Oh, I see.	intro	65	-1	
intro	64	Holly	“A storm surge is water pushed inland by very strong winds, usually during very strong typhoons; on the other hand, a tsunami happens when water is displaced by earthquakes.”	intro	65	-1
