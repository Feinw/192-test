evac	26	b	see, i wanted to get back to the house as fast as possible	evac	27	-1
evac	27	b	so i asked around but the shortest path to getting there is still flooded	evac	28	-1

evac	32	b	if you say so	postdisaster1	0	-1

event1	1	b	my god, it's scarier than what I was imagining just a minute ago	event1	2	-1
event1	2	b	… and to think that I’m in tacloban right now	event1	3	-1
event1	3	b	… and this heavy rain	event1	4	-1
event1	4	b	part of me wants to ignore this and say that you guys are just bluffing	event1	5	-1
event1	5	b	but not gonna lie, part of me is freaking out right now	event1	6	-1
event1	6	b	the rain and winds just seem to be getting stronger every minute	event1	7	-1
event1	7	b	and, well, I guess I should've said this earlier	event1	8	-1
event1	8	b	i thought it was just a bunch of spam	event1	9	-1
event1	9	b	but i actually received a storm surge warning from ndrrmc just a few days ago	event1	10	-1
event1	10	a	What??	event1	11	-1
event1	11	a	Who knows what bad thing could have happened if you haven’t mentioned that! You could have drowned, you could have contracted some stomach disease, or even suffered from leptospirosis!	event1	12	-1
event1	12	b	yeah, yeah	event1	13	-1
event1	13	b	you can’t blame me	event1	14	-1
event1	14	b	i literally thought “storm surge” was just a fancy term for “heavy rain”	event1	15	-1
event1	15	b	they didn’t teach it at school	event1	16	-1
event1	16	a	Well, you’re not completely blameless either, you know.	event1	17	-1
event1	17	b	yeah, i know	event1	18	-1
event1	18	b	i'm just hoping it’s not too late to realize that yet	choice	10,11	-1
event1	19	a	Don’t say that!	event1	21	-1
event1	20	a	[Player] is right.	event1	21	-1
event1	21	a	You can still try making last minute preparations to lessen the damage.	event1	22	-1
event1	22	a	What does the NDRRMC text say?	event1	23	-1
event1	23	b	they said they’re anticipating the storm surge three days from now	event1	24	-1
event1	24	a	Good.	event1	25	-1
event1	25	b	good?	event1	26	-1
event1	26	b	I mean I know all about storm surges now but i still have no clue what to do	event1	27	-1
event1	27	a	hmm, maybe this'll help	minigame	1	-1
event1	28	b	nice! thanks for helping me guys	event1	29	-1
event1	29	b	oh hey	event1	30	-1
event1	30	b	i just received another message from ndrrmc	event1	31	-1
event1	31	b	they said that there’s an evacuation center not far from my current location and that it’s currently safe to evacuate	event1	32	-1
event1	32	b	i guess i better go tell my family	event1	33	-1
event1	33	b	i’ll talk to you guys again later when i get there	evac	0	-1
event2	0	b	huh? why?	event2	1	-1
event2	1	a	oh, i get it!	event2	2	-1
event2	2	a	It won’t be safe to pump water out of the basement if there’s still water surrounding the walls from the outside.	event2	3	-1
event2	3	a	Right now, the pressure inside and outside the basement are a bit balanced, considering that your basement walls are still up.	event2	4	-1
event2	4	a	But if you reduce the pressure from the inside, your walls might not be able to take the outside pressure.	event2	5	-1
event2	5	b	and it will break…	event2	6	-1
event2	6	a	Exactly.	event2	7	-1
event2	7	b	when is it safe to pump the water out, then	choice	24	-1
event2	8	b	oh, cool. i guess i’ll have to wait a while then	event2	9	-1
event2	9	b	i’ll see what else i can do for the meantime and maybe somewhere a bit drier	event2	10	-1
event2	10	a	You know, amidst this horrible disaster, I’m actually glad that [b] is finally learning how to listen to us.	event2	11	-1
event2	11	a	He used to be so stubborn and defiant.	event2	12	-1
event2	12	a	If I had known that this experience was all it would take for him to start functioning like a pleasant human being, I would have wished this on him sooner.	choice	25,26	-1
event2	13	a	That was a joke, of course.	event2	14	-1
event2	14	a	You didn’t think I was serious, did you?	event2	15	-1
event2	15	b	uhh, so i’m just gonna pretend i didnt see that	event2	16	-1
event2	16	b	ugh i thought the 2nd floor would be a bit drier	event2	17	-1
event2	17	b	but it’s so moist!	event2	18	-1
event2	18	b	the moistness is so extreme that i might as well just dive into the flood	event2	19	-1
event2	19	a	Yikes.	event2	20	-1
event2	20	b	is there anything i should do about this? Or is there anything i could do about it?	event2	21	-1
event2	21	a	Do you guys have a dehumidifier?	event2	22	-1
event2	22	b	i think we do, i might’ve seen one in the attic before	event2	23	-1
event2	23	a	How about an air mover?	event2	24	-1
event2	24	b	what are those?	event2	25	-1
event2	25	a	They’re basically air blowers. They’re used to improve air circulation to reduce drying times	event2	26	-1
event2	26	b	won’t an electric fan e enough?	event2	27	-1
event2	27	b	i mean… they blow air...	event2	28	-1
event2	28	a	Fans usually circulate the air in multiple directions while air movers circulate them in a specific area.	event2	29	-1
event2	29	a	Drying things might still be faster using an air mover.	event2	30	-1
event2	30	a	However, using humidifiers and air movers can get quite tricky when using to lessen the damages from floods.	event2	31	-1
event2	31	a	It usually takes the right balance of both	event2	32	-1
event2	32	b	cool, well, i can still check if we have both of them	event2	33	-1
event2	33	a	Or, you know, another option is to just open your windows tolet fresh air in.	event2	34	-1
event2	34	b	what should i do?	choice	27,28	-1
event3	0	a	Oh right,that completely slipped my mind for some reason.	event3	1	-1
event3	1	a	I agree with [Player], keep everything electronic switched off for now.	event3	2	-1
event3	2	a	I’m sorry for even suggesting it in the first place.	event3	3	-1
event3	3	b	nah, it’s fine	event3	4	-1
event3	4	b	wow, opening the windows really made the air inside feel more fresh	event3	5	-1
event3	5	b	fresher than the fresh prince of bel air haha	event3	6	-1
event3	6	a	Do you even know what you’re referencing?	event3	7	-1
event3	7	b	doesnt matter, i’m feeling a little better now	event3	8	-1
event3	8	b	i can’t wait for all of this to be over	event3	9	-1
event3	9	a	Can’t you just leave? That’s your relative’s house anyway. Youre home in the city is probably still intact since [Player] and I are still doing alright.	event3	10	-1
event3	10	b	can’t. They’re still family, plus they need all the help they can get	event3	11	-1
event3	11	b	i’ll try looking for more stuff to do and make myself more useful	event3	12	-1
event3	12	b	i’ll be right back	event3	13	-1
event3	13	b	good news	event3	14	-1
event3	14	a	Great! That took quite some time though.	event3	15	-1
event3	15	b	sure did	event3	16	-1
event3	16	b	which is why i decided to be productive	event3	17	-1
event3	17	b	who knew i had a knack for stacking cans	event3	18	-1
event3	18	b	cans are amazing	event3	19	-1
event3	19	b	not gonna lie, i was getting tempted to eat some	event3	20	-1
event3	20	b	anyways, im still hungry	event3	21	-1
event3	21	b	but all the cans are sealed and im too lazy to find the can opener	event3	22	-1
event3	22	b	guess i’ll settle with drinking water instead	choice	29,30	-1
event4	0	a	Yeah, it’s important to remember that flood water isn’t just “dirty water”.	event4	1	-1
event4	1	a	At this point, its probably a mix of every dirty thing you know.	event4	2	-1
event4	2	a	Better be safe than sorry.	event4	3	-1
event4	3	b	i guess i should really, carefully disinfect everything	event4	4	-1
event4	4	b	ugh, my body already aches just thinking about the amount of work this will take	event4	5	-1
event4	5	b	anyways, you guys were right to tell me not to use the humidifier thing earlier	event4	6	-1
event4	6	b	i just noticed a while ago that there was a downed power line near my house	event4	7	-1
event4	7	b	i would’ve reported it but i didn’t really know who or where to call	event4	8	-1
event4	8	a	You could call Meralco, though I don’t really remember what their 24/7 hotline number is.	choice	31	-1
event4	9	b	thanks thanks	event4	10	-1
event4	10	b	i should call them to check our electric… stuff here at the house too	event4	11	-1
event4	11	b	okay, just called em. what now?	event4	12	-1
event4	12	a	Well, you did say that all the floodwater went down outside already, right?	event4	13	-1
event4	13	b	and?	event4	14	-1
event4	14	a	You can start pumping out the water in your basement already.	event4	15	-1
event4	15	b	makes sense	event4	16	-1
event4	16	b	better prepare myself to pump all the water out, yikes	choice	32,33	-1
event5	0	b	huh, why not?	event5	1	-1
event5	1	b	it’s not flooded outside anymore	choice	34	-1
event5	2	b	but why	event5	3	-1
event5	3	a	You’re still not sure if the pressure outside is lessened enough for you to pump out all the water inside safely.	event5	4	-1
event5	4	a	Pumping out only a bit and leaving it overnight will make you more certain about whether it’s safe to continue or not.	event5	5	-1
event5	5	b	how?	event5	6	-1
event5	6	a	If you measure the height of the water after pumping some of it out, you’ll be able to see tomorrow if the water level has increased.	event5	7	-1
event5	7	a	When the water stops rising, pump out 1-3 feet again.	event5	8	-1
event5	8	a	Its safest to repeat those steps until you’ve pumped out all of the water.	event5	9	-1
event5	9	b	huh… i see…	event5	10	-1
event5	10	b	thanks sherlock	event5	11	-1
event5	11	a	I’ll just ignore that. After the water’s gone, try to shovel out the mud before it dries.	event5	12	-1
event5	12	a	I saw this formula online too, try using this to disinfect your walls.	event5	13	-1
event5	13	a	“Hose off the walls and floors with clean water and then disinfect them with a solution of 1 1/2 cups of liquid chlorine bleach to a gallon of fresh water. CAUTION	event5	14	-1
event5	14	b	ugh, more work	event5	15	-1
event5	15	a	well, do you want to get sick from all of those bacteria?	event5	16	-1
event5	16	a	if I were you, I'd get started right away.	event5	17	-1
event5	17	b	easy for you to say	event5	18	-1

event6	0	b	now you guys are just pulling my leg	event6	1	-1
event6	1	a	No, we're telling you, a storm surge is really different from a tsunami.	event6	2	-1
event6	2	a	We might not know how exactly they are different, but we know that they are both equally dangerous	event6	3	-1
event6	3	b	whatever. i'm not falling for this	event6	4	-1
event6	4	b	a storm surge is just an extra strong rain.	event6	5	-1

event8	8	b	they said the attic’s too dusty for them	event8	9	-1
event8	9	a	dude how high is that house?	event8	10	-1
event8	10	b	not important	event8	11	-1
event8	11	b	anyway, i couldn’t sit still so i decided to look around	event8	12	-1
event8	12	b	guess what i found?	event8	13	-1
event8	13	b	a radio!	event8	14	-1
event8	14	a	nice! But…	event8	15	-1
event8	15	a	what do you need a “physical” radio for? Don’t you have a radio on your phone?	event8	16	-1
event8	16	b	dude, i want to preserve as much battery as I can	event8	17	-1
event8	17	b	just in case something bad happens…	event8	18	-1
event8	18	b	let’s stop talking about this. I wouldn’t want to jinx it, you know?	event8	19	-1
event8	19	b	anyway, our radio is plugged so I won’t be touching the wires	event8	20	-1
event8	20	b	I’ll try turning it on	choice	47,77	-1
event9	0	b	why not?	event9	1	-1
event9	1	b	that shocked me there.	event9	2	-1
event9	2	b	and I was just about to touch it	choice	48	-1
event9	3	b	huh? What do you mean? Why would i be wet?	event9	4	-1
event9	4	b	….	event9	5	-1
event9	5	b	now that you mention it. I forgot to tell you guys that i took a peek at the basement before going up to the attic	event9	6	-1
event9	6	b	and well, it was flooding there already all right	event9	7	-1
event9	7	b	hmm i guess i must have gotten wet then. I didnt even notice.	event9	8	-1
event9	8	b	Wow my pants are soaked	event9	9	-1
event9	9	b	doesn’t help that i’m also sweating from head to toe	event9	10	-1
event9	10	b	its so humid here	event9	11	-1
event9	11	b	but... What’s that got to do with the radio?	event9	12	-1
event9	12	a	you might get yourself electrocuted, duh	event9	13	-1
event9	13	b	why?	event9	14	-1
event9	14	a	well, you did say your radio’s still plugged. Even though you guys had a black out, there’s a chance that the plug is still carrying electric current	event9	15	-1
event9	15	a	the human body is a good conductor for electricity, you know?	event9	16	-1
event9	16	a	touching it with wet hands, especially, will increase the risk since water is a good conductor as well	event9	17	-1
event9	17	a	moisture also actually reduces the body’s resistance to electric shocks	choice	49	-1
event9	18	a	yeah, so it’s best to make sure you’re dry before touching electrical devices	event9	19	-1
event9	19	b	geez, sherlock	event9	20	-1
event9	20	b	I’m touching my phone right now, though, and I’m still fine	event9	21	-1
event9	21	a	you’re not charging your phone right now, right?	event9	22	-1
event9	22	a	and you’re not completely submerged in water?	event9	23	-1
event9	23	a	there isn’t enough electric current in a cell phone to electrocute you	event9	24	-1
event9	24	a	it’s different, though, if it’s plugged in and if you’re using a substandard (fake) charger with bad insulation	event9	25	-1
event9	25	a	but that’s a story for another day	event9	26	-1
event9	26	a	the bottom line is, just make sure to avoid electric devices when wet	event9	27	-1
event9	27	b	alright.	event9	28	-1
event9	28	b	thanks. You guys saved me once again.	event9	29	-1
event9	29	b	hmm i guess i better dry myself first	event9	30	-1
event9	30	b	be right back	notif	8	-1
event9	31	b	alright, i’m dry and i’ve successfully turned the radio on	event9	32	-1
event9	32	b	i’ve switched through a couple of channels but the only channels i’ve found promising so far are the news channels	event9	33	-1
event9	33	b	like Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM	choice	50	-1
event9	34	b	uhh… what is that?	event9	35	-1
event9	35	b	I dont think I do…	event9	36	-1
event9	36	a	oh yeah! Ham!	event9	37	-1
event9	37	a	I read about that in a news article about the storm surge in tacloban	event9	38	-1
event9	38	a	there’s something called a Ham Emergency Radio Operations (HERO) that was conducted by the Philippine Amateur Radio Association (PARA)	event9	39	-1
event9	39	a	I don’t know if you guys have heard about this, but during the typhoon, a school building that was being used as an evacuation center collapsed and injured some of the evacuees.	event9	40	-1
event9	40	a	there weren’t any volunteers around because the typhoon was especially strong at that time	event9	41	-1
event9	41	a	A HERO volunteer was able to report the incident and was able to send a request for a rescue team	event9	42	-1
event9	42	a	what the HERO volunteer used to communicate this was called an amateur radio or “ham”	event9	43	-1
event9	43	a	the volunteer’s request got relayed from station to station until it reached the rescue teams	event9	44	-1
event9	44	b	wow. I didn’t even know that there was such a thing as an “amateur radio”	event9	45	-1
event9	45	a	well, it’s mostly for hobbyists and radio enthusiasts and you usually need to have a license for it	event9	46	-1
event9	46	a	but it does prove to be useful in case of disasters	event9	47	-1
event9	47	a	i’ve been thinking about getting one myself, but forgot about it until now	event9	48	-1
event9	48	b	hmm yeah maybe i should get one too	event9	49	-1
event9	49	b	would be really useful if I had one and if I knew how to operate it	choice	51	-1
event9	50	b	how so?	event9	51	-1
event9	51	a	hmm… ndrrmc?	event9	52	-1
event9	52	b	oh yeah, i did receive a warning from them a few days ago	event9	53	-1
event9	53	b	ugh and im still regretting not taking it seriously	event9	54	-1
event9	54	b	but how are you sure that we’ll be receiving their messages?	event9	55	-1
event9	55	b	people from everywhere will be sending lots of messages for sure	event9	56	-1
event9	56	b	ndrrmc’s messages might arrive late	event9	57	-1
event9	57	a	ndrrmc partnered with Smart and ndrrmc now sends their messages through a radio channel that’s separate from what normal citizens use in sending our text messages.	event9	58	-1
event9	58	a	it’s not guaranteed, but they try to make sure the warning messages arrive early	event9	59	-1
event9	59	b	ah! Speaking of ndrrmc	event9	60	-1
event9	60	b	I just received a message	event9	61	-1
event9	61	b	they said that there’s an evacuation center not far from my current location and that it’s currently safe to evacuate	event9	62	-1
event9	62	b	i guess i better go tell my family	event9	63	-1
event9	63	b	i’ll talk to you guys again later when i get there	evac	0	-1

goodending	23	b	actually…	goodending	24	-1

intro	15	a	At least after the rain’s finished.	intro	16	-1
intro	16	b	cant	intro	17	-1

intro	18	b	you know, visiting my relatives, instead.	choice	2	-1
intro	19	a	Goodness,that reminds me. This gloomy rain and you saying Tacloban just reminded me of something.	intro	20	-1
intro	20	a	The Yolanda typhoon. Do you guys remember?	intro	21	-1
intro	21	b	oh yeah, that was great	choice	3,4	-1
intro	22	b	Ha! [Player] gets me.	intro	23	-1
intro	23	a	What are you guys talking about?	intro	25	-1
intro	24	b	you guys don’t get it?	intro	25	-1
intro	25	b	typhoon yolanda. that typhoon that blessed us week long holidays away from school	intro	26	-1
intro	26	b	It felt like a second summer vacation	intro	27	-1
intro	27	a	What the hell?	intro	28	-1
intro	28	a	That was a disaster where lots of people lost their homes, families and even their lives.	intro	29	-1
intro	29	b	well, boohoo, look for someone who cares. I’d wish ANYTHING for no classes.	intro	30	-1
intro	30	b	in fact, i kinda wish that it wouldn’t rain while we’re on vacation and just rain when classes start again	intro	31	-1
intro	31	b	so u know, extended holidays for us all	intro	32	-1
intro	32	b	right, [Player]?	intro	33	-1
intro	33	a	Are you kidding? Back me up here, [Player]. I can’t be the only sensible one here.	choice	5	-1
intro	34	a	Right, around 3000 people died in Tacloban, and about 6000 died, counting the other parts of the country	intro	35	-1
intro	35	b	darn(d*mn), i’m almost more surprised that you know all that on the top of your head	intro	36	-1
intro	36	b	all those people really died just because of some rain?	intro	37	-1
intro	37	b	sure, yolanda was a pretty strong bagyo, but it wasn’t that strong	intro	38	-1
intro	38	b	how do you even know these things?	intro	39	-1
intro	39	a	I read the news, like what everyone should do.	intro	40	-1
intro	40	a	Also, it wasn’t the rain that did the damage.	intro	41	-1
intro	41	b	the winds, then? they were pretty strong, I guess	intro	42	-1
intro	42	a	No, not the winds. I think it was a tsunami.	choice	6,7	-1
intro	43	a	hmm… that doesn’t sound quite right	intro	44	-1
intro	44	b	yeah it doesn’t. how is there a tsunami if it’s just a typhoon?	intro	45	-1
intro	45	b	there weren’t any earthquakes or anything	intro	46	-1
intro	46	a	I know I did say it was a tsunami, but it really wasn’t. I just can’t seem to remember what actually happened.	intro	47	-1
intro	47	b	well, that’s a first	intro	48	-1
intro	48	b	maybe you can just admit that i’m right and perhaps it was the heavy rain, afterall	intro	49	-1
intro	49	b	since, u know, it’s a storm	intro	50	-1
intro	50	a	That’s it!	intro	51	-1
intro	51	a	I remember it now. Yes, it was a storm surge	intro	52	-1
intro	52	b	uhh…	intro	53	-1
intro	53	b	a storm surge?	intro	54	-1
intro	54	b	… an extra heavy rain?	intro	55	-1
intro	55	a	You make me want to punch my face.	intro	56	-1
intro	56	b	then what is it?? Just tell me	intro	57	-1
intro	57	a	well…	intro	58	-1
intro	58	a	I guess you could say it’s like a tsunami.	intro	59	-1
intro	59	b	it’s like a tsunami but it’s not a tsunami?	intro	60	-1
intro	60	a	Well, truth be told, I’m not really sure what a storm surge is either.	intro	61	-1
intro	61	a	I just know that it’s different from a tsunami	intro	62	-1
intro	62	a	[Player], do you know?	choice	8,9	-1
intro	63	a	Oh, I see.	intro	65	-1
intro	64	a	“A storm surge is water pushed inland by very strong winds, usually during very strong typhoons; on the other hand, a tsunami happens when water is displaced by earthquakes.”	intro	65	-1

postdisaster1	30	b	for some reason, the guest rooms are on the second floor	postdisaster1	31	-1
postdisaster1	31	b	anyway, they said they preferred having the rooms on the first floor so that they won’t have to walk far on a tiring day	postdisaster1	32	-1
postdisaster1	32	b	which is understandable, by the way	postdisaster1	33	-1
postdisaster1	33	b	this house is HUGE	postdisaster1	34	-1

postdisaster1	47	b	(I only overheard that during the adults’ talk)	postdisaster1	48	-1

postdisaster1	50	b	well, there’s still stuff on the 2nd floor and above	postdisaster1	51	-1
postdisaster1	51	b	but they lost a lot	postdisaster1	52	-1
postdisaster1	52	b	even with how rich they are, there’ll be a huge dent in their savings just to recover from this	postdisaster1	53	-1

postdisaster1	59	b	alright…	postdisaster1	60	-1
postdisaster1	60	b	i guess i should get started on pumping water out. The basement is still quite flooded	postdisaster1	61	-1
